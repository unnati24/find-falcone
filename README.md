# WaitlistedLabs

The project is a game developed using Angular 8. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.3.

## Problem Context

Our problem is set in the planet of Lengaburu in the distant galaxy of Tara B. After the recent war with neighbouring planet Falicornia, King Shan has exiled the Queen of Falicornia for 15 years. Queen Al Falcone is now in hiding. But if King Shan can find her before the years are up, she will be exiled for another 15
years.

## Walthrough

The web application is for King Shan, who will have to select four of six planets and vehicles to travel based on availability. Once the choices are made, the search is carried out and the King is notified if the Queen was found or not.
